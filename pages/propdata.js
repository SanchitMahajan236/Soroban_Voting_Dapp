We propose the creation of a dedicated Soroban Developer Community to foster collaboration, innovation, and knowledge sharing among developers working on the Soroban smart contract platform. This community will serve as a hub for developers to exchange ideas, share best practices, and support each other in building robust decentralized applications on Soroban. By organizing regular meetups, webinars, and hackathons, we aim to accelerate the development of high-quality projects and facilitate networking opportunities. Additionally, we will establish an online forum and resource repository to provide comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and code samples. This initiative will not only enhance the skill sets of individual developers but also contribute to the overall growth and success of the Soroban ecosystem. We believe that a vibrant developer community is crucial for driving innovation and adoption, and we seek your support to bring this vision to life.
